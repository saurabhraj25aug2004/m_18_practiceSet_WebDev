    <h1>What is SEO?</h1>
    <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It's the practice of improving the ranking of a website 
        on search engine results pages (SERPs). The higher your website ranks in SERPs, 
        the more likely people are to visit your site.</p>
    <h2>Why is SEO Important?</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why SEO is important for businesses and individuals alike:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased website traffic: Higher ranking in search results leads to more organic traffic 
            (visitors who find your site through search engines).</li>
        <li>Improved brand awareness: When your website appears for relevant searches, 
            more people will be exposed to your brand.</li>
        <li>More leads and sales: Increased website traffic can lead to more leads and sales,
             especially if your website is well-optimized for conversions.</li>
        <li>Cost-effective marketing: SEO is a relatively cost-effective way to market your website
             compared to paid advertising.</li>
    </ul>
